# Web Marketing-Dashboard
## Description
The Web Marketing Dashboard created in Tableau offers a comprehensive visual analysis of website performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to quickly assess traffic patterns, user engagement, and content effectiveness. The dashboard follows a clean, structured layout with a consistent green color scheme, ensuring clarity and visual harmony.

## Key Insights Displayed
-At the top, four key performance indicators (KPIs) are prominently displayed:
-Total Sessions (418,062) – the overall number of visits to the website.
-Total Exits (139,310) – the number of times users left the site from a particular page.
-Average Page Load Time (71.61s) – the mean time it takes for a page to load, highlighting performance optimization needs.
-Average Time on Page (98s) – the average duration users spend on a page, indicating content engagement levels.
-Beneath these KPIs, a bar chart titled Latest Year Sessions shows monthly traffic patterns, with figures ranging from approximately 20,000 to 30,000 sessions, enabling the identification of seasonal trends or campaign impacts.
-The dashboard also highlights Total Bounces (90,216) – instances where users left after viewing only one page – and Total Unique Pageviews (624,704), representing distinct views across the site.
-In the Overview section, a device breakdown displays session and bounce distribution across desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. Desktop sessions (292,287) dominate, followed by mobile (113,691) and tablet (12,084), with corresponding bounce counts. This segmentation provides insights into device-specific performance and optimization priorities.
-A line chart visualizes the historical trend of sessions and bounces from 2018 to 2019, revealing growth trajectories and possible performance spikes.
-Finally, two bar chart panels showcase the Top 5 Pageviews by Page Title. The first panel presents absolute counts, with pages attracting between ~35,000 and ~48,000 views. The second panel uses a stacked bar format, breaking down multiple page titles with counts from ~8,400 to ~15,998, offering granular visibility into the most visited content.
